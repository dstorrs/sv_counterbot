NAME
    CounterBot

SYNOPSIS
    Counts up votes in a quest on SufficientVelocity. Uses approval voting,
    so questers can vote for multiple plans.

SYNOPSIS
        $ ./perl_tallyho.pl --page http://forums.sufficientvelocity.../page-2  [--id 111] [--stop 212] [--gm bob,kim] [--space 3]

    (NB: The square brackets mean 'optional parameter'.  Do not
    actually include the '[' or ']' on your command line.)
	
    The above command says "start with this URL and roll forward to
    the end of the thread. Ignore anything before post #111 and stop
    when you get to post #212. The GMs are users 'bob' and 'kim', so
    ignore their posts.  Finally, give me 2 extra blank lines (total
    of 3) between plans in the output."

    Anything in [quote][/quote] tags will be ignored. Anything by
    someone listed as a GM will be ignored.

    NOTE: SV does not use, and will not respond to, URLs ending in 'page-1'.
    If you get an empty report back, the first thing to do is verify that
    the URL you used actually works.

COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS

    Parameters can be given in two forms: two hypens followed by the
    full name of the parameter, or a single hyphen followed by one
    letter.  These examples are equivalent:

        ./perl_tallyho.pl --start https://a-big-long-url
        ./perl_tallyho.pl -s      https://a-big-long-url

    --start <URL> (aliases: --page, -s, -p)
    Specifies the URL to start counting at.  Note that you cannot have
      'page-1' on your URL, as SV considers that to be an invalid URL.

	--id <NUMBER>
    The first post ID that should be included in the tally.  Note that
    the 'gm' flag will trump this; if you specify --id 10 but post #10
    was written by someone marked as a GM then #10 will be ignored as
    expected.
	
    --stop <NUMBER>
    The last post that should be included in the tally. i.e., "--stop
    20" means that post #20 *will* be counted.

    --gm bob,kim,tom
    --gm "bob,Annoying User With Spaces In His Name"   #  Note the double quotes!
    --gm bob --gm kim --tom
    Specify users whose posts should be ignored.  Typically you want
    to ignore gamemaster posts, which is why the parameter is 'gm'.
    Note that you can either use --gm each time or combine all the
    names into one comma-separated string.  If you have usernames that
    include spaces you'll need to wrap the whole thing in double
    quotes.  If you have usernames that include commas then you need a
    better class of username

    --space <NUMBER>
    By default there will be 1 blank line between plans.  Some
    browsers (Chrome and Safari) have different ideas about what a
    "blank line" is and will collapse the whole report together.  Use
    '--space' to work around this.  --space 2 means use 2 blank lines,
    --space 3 means use three, etc.


DESCRIPTION
    Reads through from the specified page (or post) to the last page in the
    thread, compiles a list of all votes, and then spits out a report at the
    end summarizing who voted for what.

    Pages are cached for 1 hour, so if you run it once and then again
    a little bit later it won't have to download the pages again the
    second time.  On each run we always fetch the page that you are
    starting from and the last-downloaded page from the previous run
    so as to ensure we are not working with stale data.

  How to Vote
    Votes can look like any of these:

        [x] Arrival
        [X] Arrival + Wands
        [+] Arrival + Wands + Survivors

    The part in brackets says that it's a vote, whatever comes after it is
    the name of the vote. 'Plan' and 'Plan:' will be stripped off the front,
    so "[x] Plan: Foo" is the same as "[x] Foo"

    Players can vote for as many plans as they want. If they want to change
    a vote then they need to cancel their old vote and issue a new one. For
    example, if Bob wants to stop voting for 'Arrival' and start voting for
    'Arrival + Wands', he would do this:

        [-] Arrival
        [x] Arrival + Wands

    (Again, that [x] could also be an [X] or an [+]. The bot is intendede to
    be as permissive as possible.)

  The Report
    A typical report might be:

        CounterBot (eaglejarl), version <N>

        [B]Plan name: [URL=https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5468116/]Arrival[/url][/B]
        Voters: @AZATHOTHoth, @Citrus, @FullNothingness, @godofbiscuit, @Jackercracks, @Kingspace, @Sigil, @tarrangar, @TempestK, @TheEyes, @Void Stalker
        Num votes:  11
    
        [B]Plan name: [URL=https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5469924/]Arrival + Wands[/url][/B]
        Voters: @Angle, @DonLyn, @FullNothingness, @HyperCatnip, @Jackercracks, @Radvic, @rangerscience, @RedV, @Solace
        Num votes:  9
    
        [B]Plan name: [URL=https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/5469924/]Arrival + Wands + Survivors[/url][/B]
        Voters: @Angle, @Jack Stargazer, @Jackercracks, @rangerscience, @TheEyes
        Num votes:  5
    
        ...etc...

    The various plans are linked back to where they were defined and
    everyone who voted is given an alert so that they know the results are
    up and can confirm their votes if they like.

    Note that this is *approval voting*. In the report above, @Jackercracks
    voted for three separate plans so he's listed on all those plans. That's
    a feature, not a bug.

USE ON OTHER SITES
    With some minor tweaks CounterBot would probably work on any other board
    written on the same codebase as SV (e.g. SpaceBattles and Questionable
    Questing). The only change should be to turn the constant BASE_URL into
    a command line param; let me know if anyone wants that.

EDGE CASES AND NOTES
  Retconned votes cause improper linking in the report
    Once in a while you'll see this:

     - Al writes post #2
     - Bob writes post #3 with the "[X] Do FOO" voting plan
     - Al goes back and edits post #2 to contain a vote for "Do FOO".

    In this case the plan will be linked to post #2, since that was where
    CounterBot first saw the plan referenced.

    There's not much to do about this, so ask the players not to retcon
    their votes.

  Voting by username is deliberately not supported
    The other tallybots on SV support voting by username, like so:

    In post #2 Alice writes: "[x] Plan Take Back Our Library From The Bad
    Guys!"

    In post #7 Bob writes: "[x] Alice"

    Bob is saying "vote for the plan that Alice wrote". This works in
    first-past-the-post voting, where each person can only have one plan and
    each voter can only vote for one plan. With approval voting you can't
    vote by username because if the person went back and added another plan
    later you would suddenly be voting for that as well.

TODO
    - A config file should be established so that standard variables (e.g.
    GM names) don't need to be entered each time. Could replace CLI options
    entirely, although it's still good to have those for convenience.

    - Cache pages in a subfolder so that we don't need to retrieve them
    every time.
